Today, our team set out to explore the newly discovered site near Luxor. The area appears untouched, and I can barely contain my excitement. Ancient hieroglyphs on the outer walls suggest a connection to the Middle Kingdom, 
possibly around 2000 BCE. If the site proves authentic, this could be the most significant discovery of my career. Tomorrow, we begin the delicate work of excavation.

It’s been weeks of grueling work, but today, we made an astonishing discovery: a statue of Anubis, carved in black basalt and sandstone, standing nearly eight feet tall. It seems to almost glow an ephemeral blue from the 
gems adorning it. Its craftsmanship is exquisite, the details on the jackal’s head strikingly lifelike. The base bears inscriptions that seem to name a pharaoh, though the writing is faint and partially eroded. Anubis, 
the god of mummification and the afterlife, was deeply revered. Could this statue have been a guardian for the pharaoh it references?

The Anubis statue continues to yield secrets. Today, our epigrapher confirmed the faint name on the base: Senusret I, a Middle Kingdom ruler known for his ambitious building projects. This aligns with our initial dating of 
the site. Anubis was often associated with protecting the deceased and guiding them through the afterlife. The placement of this statue, near what appears to be an entrance to a tomb, suggests it served as a spiritual guardian 
for the pharaoh buried here.

Further excavation has revealed an antechamber filled with funerary objects: canopic jars, jewelry, and small amulets shaped like Anubis. These artifacts suggest the tomb is royal, possibly that of Senusret I himself or a 
family member. Anubis’s connection to pharaohs lies in his role as a protector of the dead, ensuring their journey to the afterlife was safe. This chamber might have been designed to invoke his divine protection.

The tomb’s layout is becoming clearer. We uncovered a corridor lined with wall carvings depicting Anubis performing the Opening of the Mouth ritual on a pharaoh. This ceremony was vital in Egyptian funerary traditions, as 
it ensured the deceased could eat, drink, and speak in the afterlife. The reverence for Anubis here is striking. His presence underscores how integral he was to pharaonic beliefs about death and the afterlife.

This morning, we uncovered a sealed stone door, heavily decorated with images of Anubis. I suspect it leads to the burial chamber. The inscriptions depict him standing beside a throne, perhaps symbolizing his role in weighing 
the heart of the deceased during the judgment process. For pharaohs, Anubis’s connection wasn’t just spiritual but also practical—he ensured their rightful place among the gods. Tomorrow, we attempt to open the door.

Today, we entered the burial chamber. The air was thick with dust and history. At its center lay a sarcophagus, flanked by two smaller statues of Anubis, each holding a staff. The chamber’s walls told the story of the pharaoh’s 
journey to the afterlife, with Anubis guiding him at every turn. This discovery reinforces Anubis’s profound connection to pharaohs as their protector in both life and death. Standing in this sacred space, I felt the weight of 
history—and the privilege of preserving it for future generations.

This site has revealed so much about the ancient Egyptians’ beliefs and the critical role Anubis played in ensuring their eternal life. I can only hope we’ve done justice to the legacy of these extraordinary people.
